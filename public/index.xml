      <description>At the start I want to point out that all opinions in this piece are just that - opinions. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried multiple workflows and all I want to do in this article is sharing what I&amp;rsquo;ve landed at and what difficulties I&amp;rsquo;ve had using other methods of developing in kubernetes. My main motivation for writing it is sparing someone difficutlies related with setting up dev environment. There are many solutions out there claiming that make working with k8s easier, but as usually with greater ease of development comes another layer of abstraction that sometimes might actually make things worse.</description>

Sooner rather than later I found out that rust builds that we&amp;rsquo;re rather quick locally took ages in CI, resulting in poor CI feedback experience and test times exceeding 15minutes. This post was made to help people struggling with simmilar issues.
Project Structure The way I structure my projects will influence some of the futhurer solutions, so I thought it&amp;rsquo;s worthwhile sharing</description>
