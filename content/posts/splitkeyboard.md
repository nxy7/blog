Hello everyone! I've decided to write this post the very same day that I've managed to build my Lily58 keyboard (in part to practice and break habits formed from using regular keyboard). Anyway, in case that you've never heard of split keyboards, those little devices are supposed to be more ergonomic variant of regular keyboards. The theory behind it is that our hands need to maintain unnatural position when using regular keyboards. Split keyboards are cut in half and both halves can move independently, so your wrists can sit in more natural position. That's not all though. Many people decide to raise inner side of both keyboards, so your hands can lie on the table in your natural resting position.
What are alleged benefits of such setups? Less health issues with wrists, it helps with carpal tunnel syndrome and should be more comfortable. 

# Day 1
Enough theory though. It's my first day with the keyboard and there are few things I've noticed. First - It's not more comfortable at first. I can feel slight stretch in my hand, that I suspect are caused by different hand position. This keyboard is different, and my hands need to get used to it. This stretch is on verge of becoming painful, so it's probably good idea to limit my keyboard training sessions at first. Another thing is that I really enjoy having both halves of the keyboards apart. Somehow it improves my posture and feels really nice. I think that regular keyboards cause you to squash your shoulders inside, but with split keyboards there's no need to do that, and it feels very liberating. I've tried monkeytype to test my typing speed, and I've ended up getting 75 wpm on regular keyboard and 38 on split one. Not bad considering it's my first day, but I'm making a lot of mistakes that hopefully will go away as I gain more experience. Let's see if there will be any significant changes in upcoming days.

# Day 2
This is very small update, I've remapped some keys (mainly shift and ctrl) and my experience now is much more comfortable. 
It's only second day, but I'm already breaking 40 wpm barrier consistently (with best scores over 50). If I end up with anything close to 60 by the end of the week I'd consider that great success :)

# Day 4
Day four - it's very nice to feel constant improvements in my speed. I'm almost getting to 70wpm mark (average scores around 65wpm), this weird feeling with strings in my hand is almost gone and the only thing that's still a little hard for me are special characters.
