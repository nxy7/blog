Hello, as someone that likes to try out new things I've used plenty of programming languages, some popular, some niche and not widely known.
This post sums up my experiences as wishlist of things I'd like my perfect language to say.

# Sum types

# Patter matching

# Error as values

# First class functions

# Some sort of clean compile time execution

# Type inference

# Implicit memory allocations

# Options/Results types and some syntax around them

# Haskell-like try block

# Named function parameters

# Package manager

# LSP

# No garbage collection (not really important)

# Colorless async?
